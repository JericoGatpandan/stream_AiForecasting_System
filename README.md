  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "has_more": true
  },

}
```

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "Error description",
  "details": "Detailed error message",
  "status_code": 400
}
```

## üå± Database Seeding

The `seedMVP.js` script populates the database with comprehensive sample data:

- **24 Barangays** from client/data/barangays.json
- **30+ Sensors** strategically placed across barangays
- **24 hours** of sensor readings (5-minute intervals)
- **7 days** of environmental data (hourly)
- **Current and historical** flood predictions

### Running the Seeder

```bash
cd backend
node seedMVP.js
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This will reset your database. Use `{ force: false }` in the script for production.

## ü§ñ AI Model Integration

### Current Implementation (MVP)

The system includes a mock AI prediction model (`mockAIPredictionModel`) that:
- Analyzes recent environmental data
- Considers barangay risk levels
- Generates realistic flood probabilities
- Provides confidence scores and risk classifications

### Future AI Integration

The architecture is designed for easy integration of real ML models:

```javascript
// Replace mockAIPredictionModel with:
const aiModelResult = await realAIModel.predict({
  environmental_data: recentData,
  barangay_profile: barangay,
  forecast_hours: 24
});
```

### Model Requirements

Future AI models should accept:
- **Environmental Data**: Rainfall, water levels, temperature, humidity
- **Geospatial Data**: Barangay coordinates, watershed zones
- **Historical Patterns**: Seasonal variations, flood history

And return:
- **Flood Probability**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Risk Level**: low, moderate, high, severe, extreme
- **Confidence Score**: Model certainty
- **Predicted Parameters**: Water levels, rainfall amounts
